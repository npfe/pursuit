# Pursuit<sup>PM<sup>
**Pursuit<sup>PM** is a project management application for the [web2py](http://www.web2py.com) framework.

It is based on the gtd philosophy and provides the user with a dashboard of tasks/items and their related sub-items.

Each item can be tracked with a log and a status, the status reflects at what stage the items is (e.g. In progress, done, on hold) and the log can be used to add information useful to track the item.
